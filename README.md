# Using OpenAI API

## Overview

This repository demonstrates potential examples of utilizing the API of OpenAI to accomplish various tasks. The objective is to showcase the versatility and capabilities of the OpenAI API in different contexts.

## Examples

### 1. Text Completion
   - Use the OpenAI API to generate text completions based on a given input text. Explore the power of language generation models in generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

### 2. Financial Report Retriever
   - Combine the capabilities of Langchain and the OpenAI API to create a retriever for financial reports. Upload a financial report in PDF format, and interact with a chatbot to obtain information and insights about the report.
   - Utilize Langchain for PDF parsing and extracting relevant financial information.
   - Harness the OpenAI API to provide additional context and analysis based on extracted data, allowing for interactive querying and exploration of financial reports.

## Important Information

### Langchain Integration
   - Langchain is a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks, including PDF parsing, text extraction, and document analysis.
   - Utilize Langchain's capabilities to preprocess and extract structured data from financial reports uploaded in PDF format.
   - Integrate Langchain with the OpenAI API to enhance the understanding and analysis of extracted financial data through natural language interactions.

### OpenAI API Usage
   - Obtain an API key from OpenAI to access the API endpoints required for text generation and analysis tasks.
   - Refer to the OpenAI API documentation for detailed information on available endpoints, request formats, and response structures.
   - Ensure compliance with OpenAI's usage policies, including rate limits and usage quotas, to avoid disruptions in API access.
